# Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Model
 Traffic Accident Severity Prediction

This project is a *machine learning model* for predicting the severity of road traffic accidents based on historical accident data.  
The model uses features like road conditions, weather, time, and other contributing factors to classify accidents into severity levels such as *Slight Injury, Serious Injury, or Fatal*.

---

 ## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).
- Machine learning model training with *Random Forest Classifier*.
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix).
- Feature importance visualisation to understand key factors influencing severity.
